        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <img src="back.jpg" alt="Description of image" class="image-right">
        <p>
            I hail from the vibrant Nyanza region of Kenya, where I spent my early years immersed
            in the rich culture and community of my hometown. However, my journey took a pivotal turn when I moved to
            Nairobi, the bustling capital city, for further education and personal growth.

            Nairobi, with its dynamic energy and diverse opportunities, shaped my perspectives and aspirations. The
            experiences I gathered in this vibrant metropolis laid the groundwork for my ambitions.

            Currently, I've relocated to Machakos in Eastern Kenya to pursue my college studies. This beautiful region
            offers a unique blend of tradition and modernity, making it an inspiring place for my academic and personal
            journey. My experiences across these diverse environments have deeply influenced my outlook on life and
            driven my passion for growth and learning.
